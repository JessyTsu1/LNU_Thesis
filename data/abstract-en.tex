\chapter{Abstract}

Cat and dog classification is a classic image classification problem on Kaggle. This paper uses petfinder.comâ€™s public image data set to solve this typical two-category image recognition problem. In addition, the context feature information of different layers in the fully convolutional network structure of the residual network is added, and the cross model is used to obtain a higher accuracy Target detection network model. The experimental results show that the network model has a recognition accuracy of more than 90\% for images.
